I have improve the efficiency of mmap method in test_slave.c and test_master.c
But fcntl is still faster than mmap and I haven't figure it out.

Note for the new added files(it's just for testing the efficient):
test.txt is the test case I use
run_master.sh run master 10 time
run_slave.sh run slave 10 time and return the average time of fcntl and mmap

You should run run_master.sh first and then run run_slave.sh
